--WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER-- The Gospel of Mary Magdalene reveals a very different love story from the one we've come to refer to as Christianity. Harvard-trained theologian Meggan Watterson leads us verse by verse through Mary's gospel to illuminate the powerful teachings it contains.

A gospel, as ancient and authentic as any of the gospels that the Christian bible contains, was buried deep in the Egyptian desert after an edict was sent out in the 4th century to have all copies of it destroyed. Fortunately, some rebel monks were wise enough to refuse-and thanks to their disobedience and spiritual brav

Mary Magdalene Revealed: The First Apostle, Her Feminist Gospel & the Christianity We Haven't Tried Yet by Meggan Watterson Book Review

Name: Cathryn Conroy
Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Interesting Book, but It's Focused More on the Author's Faith Journey Than on Mary Magdalene
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2023
Review: I am fascinated by Mary Magdalene, the woman whom Jesus was said to have loved above all others, according to several of the Gnostic gospels. Vilified for centuries as a prostitute and mentally disturbed woman, she shared intimate knowledge of Christ in her own lost gospel, the Gospel of Mary. Three copies of this have been found‚Äîtwo written in Greek and one in Coptic‚Äîand all three are missing the same six pages in the beginning and four pages in the middle. Someone successfully silenced Mary Magdalene. Fascinating, right?

This is not the book I was hoping it to be. I wanted it to be a book about Mary Magdalene, a book that would unravel some of the mysteries, explore who she was and what she did. But this book is about the author, Meggan Watterson, a devoted follower of Mary Magdalene who possesses an extraordinary amount of knowledge about her. Watterson not only has a Master of Theological Studies from Harvard, but also a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary at Columbia University. While she does share in this book many of the mysteries of Mary Magdalene‚Äîand it is wonderful and fascinating when she does‚Äîmost of it is about Watterson's own faith journey. Interesting, but not what I wanted.

Here are some of the things you will learn about Mary Magdalene in this book, although getting to it can feel like searching for that proverbial needle in the haystack:
‚Ä¢ Her gospel tells how to liberate the soul, not through death, but in this lifetime.

‚Ä¢ The fascinating story of how the Gospel of Mary Magdalene was found and lost and found and lost and found again.

‚Ä¢ Mary identifies seven powers that are precursors to Christianity's seven deadly sins. Could these be the "seven demons" that Luke claims Christ expelled from her?

‚Ä¢ Find out the most important and truly liberating message of Mary Magdalene's gospel.

‚Ä¢ How did Mary become the "penitent prostitute" and how was her reputation finally cleared?

‚Ä¢ What does it mean that the resurrected Jesus appeared first to Mary Magdalene?

The online description of this book says Watterson "leads us verse by verse through Mary's gospel to illuminate the powerful teachings it contains." It does not. There are short citations from Mary's gospel at the beginning of many (but not all) chapters, but it's hardly the entire document. There is a lot of good information about Mary Magdalene in this book, but you must wade through the author's faith journey to get to it.

Review: Her stories about Mary Magdalene, about herself, spoke to me again and again. I grew up on the church, and for reasons clear in this book, I saw no place for me. The forest became my church - this book started a new path, not back to the church, but to myself - my whole self.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Meggan Watterson Revealed - one woman's spiritual journey
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021
Review: I actually liked the book. But I'm giving it 2 stars not 5 because the title is incredibly misleading. The book is not about Mary Magdalene. The book is about the girl who wrote the book.

Meggan (the author) is fascinated with Mary Magdalene. She had traveled to the sites where history/legends/Bible say Mary Magdalene lived and/or where she is worshiped. And through all these travels, Meggan writes about her own spiritual awakening, discovery, and growth. As I was reading this book, I became genuinely excited and happy for Meggan, and she truly inspired me with her interpretation of Jesus' teaching through Mary Magdalene. Through my own spiritual voyage I have arrived at very similar conclusions (and I felt like I couldn't share it with anyone because it was so much out there that most main stream Christians would reject/condemn me at worst and laugh at me at best). Reading a book by a woman who actually feels similarly about Christianity and quotes some lesser known facts about the role of Mary Magdalene and women overall in early Christianity was such a gift. It was empowering. It made me feel validated. It helped me connect with my spirituality even more, and it was an engaging and an interesting read.

The reason why I'm frustrated with this book is that the cover, the title, and even the red color of the book all imply that this book is about Mary Magdalene, and Mary Magdalene really plays a side kick in this book to the main character (Meggan). You will not learn much about Mary Magdalene from this book. I also think that calling it some sort of feminist manifesto is taking the focus away from what Mary Magdalene and Jesus mean to me. Their teachings are not about being feminist or masculinist. They are about love, and soul, and about removing divisions and artificial constraints for the soul (such as labeling people as feminist or masculinist). It's about looking within and perceiving from within. I feel that calling Mary Magdalene's gospel "feminist" is a really great disservice to her gospel, and it alienates the population who would benefit incredibly from adopting the teachings in her gospel (people who are anti-feminist and feel that only the masculine energy is "god-like").

I appreciate and share Meggan Watterson's admiration for Mary Magdalene and her teachings, but I still feel cheated by how misleading that title is. I haven't learned a whole lot about Mary Magdalene and her gospel from this book. To me it was an equivalent to using a catchy, well known personality to get people's attention, and then using all that attention to talk about oneself.

And just to give you an idea of what the book is about, here are some quotes from the book that are representative of the content and author's writing style:

"I think that what makes a place sacred, is simply the fact that we've been called to it." p.59

"The most sacred voice we can ever hear doesn't have a voice at all. An angel, the voice of god, the presence of love, the voice of the soul, this is the sound of silence. And this truth has been hidden from us, that we contain this chorus. Every one of us." p.89

"I think this is how we pray, how we meditate, like Mary Magdalene. We return to love within us, within the heart, quietly, discreetly, and we don't ask for any reward or external affirmation in exchange for doing the work. The return to love is the treasure itself." p.94

"The ultimate objective is to restore the bond between masculine and feminine, between all those "opposites" that create this illusion of separateness. The ultimate objective is union." p. 119

"We forget that feminine is a part of us. That the feminine is an essential half of what it means to be human and what it means to know god." p. 197

And finally:

"This is how, for me at least, I can "announce the Good news," as a voice in service of love.
The good news that god is, simply Good, that god is not male or female, or removed from us, high above and beyond our comprehension. God is simply the good, which exists within, and between, each one of us.
The good news that there is no such thing as sin. We have nothing to be ashamed of in being human, in having a body, in feeling all that this body knows, which is lost to the intellect and beyond reason." p.215

Title: .0 out of 5 stars A collection of essays
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023
Review: I enjoyed reading this compilation of essays but the title is misleading. Each of the essays is written by a different author who references the gospels but only as a starting point to put forth their particular agenda narrative. Each essay is worth reading, but the focus on the actual gospels is often minimal. I had bought the book with the intent to learn more about what the gospels actually said and implied. Perhaps another book will be more to the point.

Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023
Review: I read this book as part of a book club and I am so grateful that I did. From the first time I heard the alternative backstory for Mary Magdalene (not the standard Christian backstory), it has resonated deeply in my heart. The timing of this book for me was perfect as I'd just started learning about Mary's gospel and was fascinated by those passages. What this book did for me is provide some rich context so many of those verses and create a more realistic picture of the deeply personal relanship between Mary and Yeshua and how they gave each other the greatest gift of being both fully human and fully divine. This book offers illumination of the meaning behind the words and the heart at the center of all accounts of Christ. I loved it so much that I can't wait to read it again.
